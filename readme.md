## James Savery Quilter submission

- Look for "D_N" spread across the project (Ie Cmnd+Shift+F), these depict "Developer Notes" and indicate my thought process during development.
- I will not be using strings or dimens for the purposes of this demo.
- For testing I've ensured to cover the basics pertaining to the base of the testing pyramid. Prod scenarios would want more comprehensive test coverage.
- Total time spent on base project: ~5.5 hours, with tests ~7.5 hours.
